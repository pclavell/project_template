# Mel√© lab project template directory


## Installation instructions

* **Set up local mounting structure**:
Mountings are a way to acces remote filesystems (eg. HPC cluster) as they were integrated into our local filesystem (as if they were inside our computer).
We recommend having two directoriess, one for `/gpfs/projects/bsc83` (aka projects) and another for `/gpfs/scratch/bsc83` (aka scratch).
You can do it as follows (recommendation: add it in the `~/.bashrc` as a function):
```bash
sudo vim ~/.bashrc # you can also use nano or manually edit it with a GUI
```
Copy the following functions within `~/.bashrc` (remember to manually replace `<bscuser>`, `<projects_target_directory>` (where projects will be mounted to) and `<scratch_target_directory>` (where scratch will be mounted to):
```bash
mountprojects(){
echo "-Trying to mount MareNostrum5: Projects"
sshfs -o workaround=rename <bscuser>@transfer1.bsc.es:/gpfs/projects/bsc83/ <projects_target_directory> # replace with your bsc user and your target directory (eg. /home/pclavell/mounts/projects)
echo "MareNostrum5 Projects mounted"
}

mountscratch(){
echo "Trying to mount MareNostrum5: Scratch"
sshfs -o workaround=rename <bscuser>@transfer1.bsc.es:/gpfs/scratch/bsc83/ <scratch_target_directory> # replace with your bsc user and your target directory (eg. /home/pclavell/mounts/scratch)
echo "MareNostrum5 Scratch mounted"
}

mountall(){
mountprojects()
mountscratch()
}
```
Create `<projects_target_directory>` and `<scratch_target_directory>`:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir <projects_target_directory>
mkdir <scratch_target_directory>
```

* **Repository cloning**: 
Enter to MareNostrum5 login4 (or your HPC cluster node with internet connection) and move to `cd /gpfs/projects/bsc83/Projects` (if you are in another HPC cluster, choose where you want the project to be located)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pclavell/project_template.git
```

* **Settings personalization**:
  1) Determine your local and MN5 usernames. To do so, run `echo $USER` in each system
  2) Open [`template_user/resources/resources.yml`](template_user/resources/resources.yml) and fill out the fields under `setup_settings` according to the MareNostrum5 structure and the local mounting structure that you have just build. Notice that there is an example and instructions indicated in the same `resources.yml` file.
  3) Run the [setup script](setup_project.py). It will automatically:
     * create project subdirs for each user
     * populate [`template_user/resources.yml`](template_user/resources/resources.yml) with local and mn5 paths for each user
     * disconnect the parent repo (project_template) (this is a cleaning step because you will no longer need it).
```bash
cd project_template
python setup_project.py
cd ../
```
* **Building the project GitHub repository**
  1) Create a [new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) on GitHub to get the repo link (used below)
  2) In *each* of the user directories (ie template_user), run:

```bash
cd <project_name>/<username>
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:<GitHub username>/<GitHub repo name>.git
git add -A
git commit -m "define dir structure"
```
  The following step is *heavily discouraged* and unnecessary. However, users lacking mounting might want to copy the whole directory to each system you need it on. For example, if initialized on MN5 and copying to local, run:
```bash
cd ../.. # go to parent dir where project sits
scp -r <bsc_username>@transfer1.bsc.es:/gpfs/projects/bsc83/Projects/<project_name> <project_name>
```
