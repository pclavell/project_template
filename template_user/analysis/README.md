## Analysis

In this folder you will find downstream tasks, usually related to data wrangling, plotting, and statistical testing.

<!-- Any notes you may want to add to the public audience about how analyses were done -->

## Organization

To help get started, we provide template R and Python files [template.R](template.R) and [template_python.ipynb](template_python.ipynb) with headers and example code that you can use to interface with the project environment. They are in resources. The headers must be copied to start your scripts, otherwise the framework won't work.

<!-- TODO add links / descriptions here
 -->

## Subfolder descriptions

<!-- leave the subfolder descriptions header here it makes the GitHub action work! -->

Details for each analysis task subfolder listed here.

<!-- * [dummy_analysis] -->

## Template resources

Included are a few files that demonstrate how to interact with the environment to make your files accessible without having to use long file paths.

* [template.R](template.R): Header and examples using R
* [template_python.ipynb](template_python.ipynb): Header and examples using Python iPython notebook
