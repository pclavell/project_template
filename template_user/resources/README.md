# USAGE
* [`resources.yml`](resources.yml): should contain exclusively project-wide settings for users.
* [`config.yml`](config.yml): should contain file locations of recurrent inputs/outputs from analysis and processing. We **heavily encourage** including here all used files outside the `<project_name>` directory, to prevent path errors when working locally with the mountings.
* [`config_mn5.yml`](config_mn5.yml): DO NOT modify, it updates automatically.


## Resources

Project-wide resources, including:

* [`resources.yml`](resources.yml): Project-wide settings for users.
* [`config.yml`](config.yml): File locations for files generated by various steps of analysis / processing.
* [`config_mn5.yml`](config_mn5.yml): Counterpart to [`config.yml`](config.yml). Automatically generated by GitHub actions. Displays absolute paths for files on MN5.
* [`utils.py`](utils.py): Utilities for use with the project structure, and the greater project.
* [`utils.R`](utils.R): Utilities for use with the project structure, and the greater project.
* [`smk_utils.py`](smk_utils.py): Utilities for use with Snakemake workflows in the project.
* [`add_links_to_readmes.py`](add_links_to_readmes.py): Script used for GitHub actions to automate addition of links to README files.
* [`add_subfolders_to_readmes.py`](add_subfolders_to_readmes.py): Script used for GitHub actions to automate addition of subdir bullet points to README files in ../processing/ and ../analysis/.
* [`save_mn5_config.py`](save_mn5_config.py): Script used for GitHub actions to save the MN5 version of the config file.
