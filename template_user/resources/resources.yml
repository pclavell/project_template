# 1. Change the entries in setup_settings according to your needs/

# NOTE: username entries must be unique for determining the system you're working on

# Developer notes:
# * we could technically make mn5_projects editable and therfore generalize to other systems...
# * if we add any foolproof utils to interface w/ resources.yml (ie, getting color schemes),
#   we could add them for real to this file
